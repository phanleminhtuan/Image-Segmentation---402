Attempt 1 : Implementation of the project in F# pure
Attempt 2 : Implementation of the project in F# impure
Attempt 3 : Implementation of the project in C# 
Runtime is different for each implementation.

F# pure : 5 mins 30 seconds for N=5, which is a segment of size 32*32
F# impure : 4 mins 40 seconds for N=5
C#: 2 seconds for N=5
